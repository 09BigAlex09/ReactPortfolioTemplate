                    Brno is the second largest city in the Czech Republic and offers many interesting places to explore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my trip, I visited several important landmarks. One of the biggest attractions is the <b>VIDA! Science Center</b>, where I could try various interactive exhibits and learn a lot about science and technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another unforgettable place was <b>Å pilberk Castle</b>, which towers above the city. The castle offers a beautiful view of all of Brno and its history is truly fascinating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides that, I enjoyed walks through the historic center, tasted local specialties, and discovered many other interesting sights.
